# Introduction #

BattleTop will be an app to replace the typical "scrap of paper" used to administer various details about combat in table-top RPGs. It's currently in **prototype status**.


# Warning #

This project and its code will not make much sense if you're not familiar with table-top RPGs and the way combat is run in those games.


# Details #

The project is still in its prototype status. What does this mean:

  * The prototype will probably double as an early alpha, playtested in a real game;
  * (disclaimer) The code is not very clean, taking several shortcuts, and doesn't follow the implied design patterns very cleanly;

In short, it's currently best to just open up the `index.html` file and get a general "feel" for what it's supposed to do. After that, _skimming_ the code to get a general idea for the setup is fine. If you want to dive deeper into the project, it's highly recommended to get in touch with us first to get an up-to-date status report of the project.


# Project Setup #
The current prototype roughly utilizes the following:

  * [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as a starting point
  * [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  * html5 for semantic markup and css (including some css3 features)
